          I led the merger of our combined products, customer experience, systems, culture,

          Social media today is centered around sharing your experiences with your followers and
          “connecting” with people via digital engagement. As a result, people are consumed by
          their phones and using digital to replace real-life experiences.
          At Twenty our mission is to enable and enrich experiences by bringing people together.
          I own, manage, and coach our teams towards solutions which help bring people together
          by increasing moments of serendipity.
